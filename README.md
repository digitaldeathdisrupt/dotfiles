# Dotfiles

Here are my dotfiles.

I made a refactor of my dotfiles. I deleted a lot of my configurations, since I'm not using Linux since a couple of years. I'm using macOS now, so I don't need a lot of configurations that I had before.

## Karabiner-Elements

This is the modification that I use: [CAPS_LOCK to Hyper/Escape, Hyper + i/j/k/l Vim navigation and others](https://ke-complex-modifications.pqrs.org/#Jesse_Tutorial_Hyper_Plus_Others).

- `Caps` to `Hyper`/`Escape`
    - `Hyper` + `i`/`j`/`k`/`l`: Vim navigation
    - Toggle `Caps` by using `rshift` + `lshift`

> This configuration is only for vainilla ANSI keyboards.
